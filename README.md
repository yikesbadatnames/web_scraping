# web_scraping

This project started as a way to use data science to be able to do exploratory analysis on linkedins job board. However, that didn't pan out as it was a little to tricky for my skill level. 

The goal now is to do something similar with a different webpage. potentially the UFC. 

Now I've just started a new position that has absoutely zero to do with webscrapping, so I think I'll have to park this project for now and continue to develope my SQL.
